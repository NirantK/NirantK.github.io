      <description>Hello, if we are meeting for the first time, a short version of my story so far: After doing research engineering for almost 4 years across startups and Samsung Research, I joined as an early machine learning engineer at Verloop.io - a B2B startup that makes customer support automation SaaS. We&amp;rsquo;re directly responsible for most Data Science needs within the business.
While there is plenty of good advice on making ML work and making a career as a Data Scientist, I want to do a retrospective on what I&amp;rsquo;ve learnt in building a team which is far more competent than I am.</description>
