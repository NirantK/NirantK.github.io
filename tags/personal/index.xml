      <description>A failure resume is, as its name suggests, a list of rejections and setbacks.
This concept originated in academia, but can be applied to improve one’s career, resilience, and approach to challenges in any walk of life.
I’ve organized my setbacks by year (starting with 2016), and what constitutes a “failure” here is based solely on my own judgement. It’s important to not only list the failures, but also learn from them, so I will add reflections to some of them (in progress).</description>

Torschlusspaniki About the word Torschlusspaniki
My previous workplaces made a serious dent in the size of my dreams.
Psychological safety is a weird concept. I wish more leaders understood this intuitively.
