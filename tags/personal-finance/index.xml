      <description>I’d written originally this in August 2019 with a bit of foresight of a pending recession.
I wrote this primarily for myself. Multiple reviewers have mentioned that they found it immensely useful, so sharing it with you here!

 Will hurt technology startup professionals which depend on VC money directly as pay cheques</description>
