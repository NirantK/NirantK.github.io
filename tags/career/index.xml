      <description>Like most of my essays, this essay is written for myself from few years ago.
Software Engineering, and it&amp;rsquo;s cousins like Computer Science are unique. Unlike relatively mature domains of say, linear algebra - the field is still growing and not yet coherent. That makes it some what hard to study and master.
This also means we have a unique opportunity here. This makes it better to work in a field which is not yet c</description>

      <title>Data Science Org Designs</title>

      <description>Data Science Org Design While there is plenty of good advice on making ML work and making a career as a Data Scientist - I think very little discussion happens on the organization design for Data Science itself.
 Organization Design is determined by these 3 broad categories:
  Software Engineer vs Research: To what extent is the Machine Learning team responsible for building or integrating with software? How important are Software Engineering skills on the team?</description>

      <description>When I show up to Dr. Bob’s office, I don’t expect to deal with Bob; I expect to deal with The Doctor. The doctor is not going to behave as Bob, Alice, or Caroline might act, even if that’s who the doctor is. The doctor is going to behave as The Doctor! This is essentially a human user interface. I’m not Samo. I am The Patient. And Alice is The Doctor.</description>

      <title>First 90 Days - Software Engineer Version</title>
      <link>https://nirantk.com/writing/first-90-days-engineer-version.html</link>

      <guid>https://nirantk.com/writing/first-90-days-engineer-version.html</guid>
      <description>Aditya Ankur, asked me:
I know that there is a book for the first 90 days as an executive. Is there something similar for programmers?
I don&amp;rsquo;t quite know of a book/essay which covers this yet sticks to the question. So I am writing one for him.
The First 90 Days for a New Engineer I expect each step to take roughly between 10 and 30 days, depending on the pace of your project + size of the team.</description>

      <title>Case Study: Building a Data Science Team at a Startup</title>

      <description>Hello!
If we are meeting for the first time, a short version of my story so far: After doing research engineering for almost 4 years across startups and a BigCo, I joined as an early machine learning engineer at Verloop.io - a B2B startup that makes customer support automation SaaS. We&amp;rsquo;re directly responsible for most Natural Language Processing needs within the business.
While there is plenty of good advice on making ML work and making a career as a Data Scientist, I wanted to write my experience as a manager/early engineer who built out a ML team at a startup.</description>

      <title>Verloop NLP Interview Prep Guide</title>
      <link>https://nirantk.com/writing/verloop-ml-prep-guide.html</link>

      <guid>https://nirantk.com/writing/verloop-ml-prep-guide.html</guid>
      <description>Preparation Guide I&amp;rsquo;ve been an early Machine Learning Engineer at Verloop.io for almost 1.5 years, primarily working on NLP problems and now more in an Engineering Manager-ish role.
This is the guide which I sometimes send to our candidates after they submit the Programming Challenge. If a candidate has relevant open source code sample, specially to other repositories we may choose to waive off the Programming Challenge completely.
I originally wrote this to give a chance to folks coming from non-NLP background to get a sense of the problem space a little better.</description>

      <title>Talent Cooling</title>

      <description>Talent Cooling Kills Startup Growth Evaporative Cooling [1] occurs when the most high value contributors to a community realize that the community is no longer serving their needs any more and so therefore, leave.
Then something remarkably interesting happens:
 When that happens, it drops the general quality of the community down such that the next most high value contributors now find the community underwhelming. Each layer of disappearances slowly reduces the average quality of the group until such a point that you reach the people who are so unskilled-and-unaware of it that they’re unable to tell that they’re part of a mediocre group.</description>

      <description>Who is this for? This is written for me, 5 years ago - when I was starting my career in Data Science. You can treat these as Notes/Advice/Rant/Opinion.
That said, I expect this to be helpful to:
  Early to Mid Career Folks in Engineering roles considering moving to ML/Data Science
  Primarily written for those in India
 Rant: If you&amp;rsquo;re not in India and any of this applies to you, please consider hiring a career coach - you&amp;rsquo;ve too much low hanging fruit in planning your career    Rant: Note that the most obnoxious, random comments will be marked by Rant.</description>

      <description>In my short career, I&amp;rsquo;ve seen some amazing young people stand out at work.
Here is what they did, organized by 5 themes:
  Unlock Knowledge
  Automate Boring Stuff
  Write Widely
  Solve Open Problems
  Outside-Visible Work
  Unlock Knowledge Expertise and know-how stay trapped in emails, docs and codebases. Unlock this for everyone else.

      <title>Act Like You&#39;re 35</title>

      <description>Don’t just network with people your own age Beware the whiz kid syndrome. Smart, young people have a habit of forming communities of other smart young people and feeding off each other’s energy. Argghhhh. Are you not just making mistakes made by older people again? Make original mistakes
Youth enclaves can actually be restrictive. In fact their networking should be about meeting useful mentors and career champions who can open doors and fast track careers.</description>

      <title>Thinking of Your Career as a Startup</title>
      <link>https://nirantk.com/writing/ruleof40.html</link>

      <guid>https://nirantk.com/writing/ruleof40.html</guid>
      <description>Broadly speaking, it’s useful to think of your career as a startup.
Your profit+growth percentage should be a minimum 40%
So say, you join a big company like Microsoft and your skills grow at 20% every year, while your pay only grows 10% - that&amp;rsquo;s bad.
You need to grow your skills and outcomes faster.
The other extreme is also fine: You join a small startup which can make great use of entrepreneurial DNA plus specific skills.</description>

      <title>Advice for Breaking into NLP outside Academia</title>
      <link>https://nirantk.com/drafts/breaking-into-nlp.html</link>

      <guid>https://nirantk.com/drafts/breaking-into-nlp.html</guid>
      <description>Bulk of this is borrowed from notes made my teammate and friend at Verloop.io&amp;rsquo;s NLP/ML team of our conversations. I&amp;rsquo;ve taken the liberty to remove our internal slang, abuses and some boring stuff.
Asker: I want to build a community around me on NLP. How can I get discovered by others?
NK: Broadly speaking, the aim in forming connections can be split into Long Term and Short term. A short term aim would be where you can receive something immediate out of the connections or a particular connection itself.</description>

      <title>Picking a Startup Team You Want to Work With</title>
      <link>https://nirantk.com/writing/picking-startup-to-work-with.html</link>

      <guid>https://nirantk.com/writing/picking-startup-to-work-with.html</guid>
      <description>Why we need to do a reference check on startup teams we work with? Great Startups always ask someone who is joining for a reference check. They speak to your previous managers and colleagues. There is no reason why candidates should not do the same. Many startup employees have more opportunity costs than the founders themselves.
I&amp;rsquo;m surprised by the lack of due diligence which candidates do when interviewing with us.</description>

      <title>How to prepare for a Data Science job from college?</title>

      <description>A Getting Started Guide
Let us get our facts straight, shall we?
I am writing from my non-existent but probably relevant experience. I worked in a Machine Learning role at Samsung Research, Bengaluru. It is only 1 of the 4 research enterprises which hire Machine Learning researchers from Indian colleges — the other being Microsoft, Xerox, and IBM Watson.
I am now in a even more Computer Vision focused role for a small enterprise tech company.</description>
