      <description>Shreyas Karanth is a Product Manager at Soroco. Soroco is a Medium-sized Enterprise-focussed B2B Automation company. Before Product Management, Shreyas was the fastest growing engineer - going from a fresh grad to a Technical Lead within 3 years of graduation.
This is also when I worked with him, during his engineering days. Here, I asked a bunch of questions why he moved to Product Management, what excites him and what he considers as Product Management work at Soroco.</description>
