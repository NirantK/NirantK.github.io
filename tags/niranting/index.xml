      <description>Gyan Session with Shreyas Shreyas Karanth is a Product Manager at Soroco. Soroco is a Large Enterprise-focussed B2B Managed Solutions company.
Before Product Management, Shreyas was the fastest growing engineer - going from a fresh grad to a Technical Lead within 3 years of graduation. This is also where I worked with him, as an engineer. Here, I asked a bunch of questions why he moved to Product Management, what excites him and what he considers as Product Management work at Soroco.</description>
