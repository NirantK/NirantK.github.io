      <title>Talent Cooling</title>

      <description>Talent Cooling Kills Startup Growth Evaporative Cooling [1] occurs when the most high value contributors to a community realize that the community is no longer serving their needs any more and so therefore, leave.
Then something remarkably interesting happens:
 When that happens, it drops the general quality of the community down such that the next most high value contributors now find the community underwhelming. Each layer of disappearances slowly reduces the average quality of the group until such a point that you reach the people who are so unskilled-and-unaware of it that they’re unable to tell that they’re part of a mediocre group.</description>

      <title>The BITS Pilani Experience</title>

      <description>There is a invisible binding thread among most BITSian’s - optimistic, easy going, but somewhat pragmatic. The sky is the limit, but most of them realize flying in hot air pockets is easy - it’s the takeoff that hurts.
I guess there is a flavour of cheerful pragmatism that is uniquely BITSian. You can get ice cream and ice cream shakes anywhere - but Sharma’s MNB is uniquely BITSian.
I am no longer in BITS Pilani.</description>

      <description>Shreyas Karanth is a Product Manager at Soroco. Soroco is a Medium-sized Enterprise-focussed B2B Automation company. Before Product Management, Shreyas was the fastest growing engineer - going from a fresh grad to a Technical Lead within 3 years of graduation.
This is also when I worked with him, during his engineering days. Here, I asked a bunch of questions why he moved to Product Management, what excites him and what he considers as Product Management work at Soroco.</description>

      <title>Fail Resume</title>
      <link>https://nirantk.com/writing/failresume/</link>

      <description>A fail resume is, as its name suggests, a list of rejections and setbacks.
This concept originated in academia, but can be applied to improve one’s career, resilience, and approach to challenges in any walk of life.
I’ve organized my setbacks by year (starting with 2016), and what constitutes a “failure” (or fail) here is based solely on my own judgement. It’s important to not only list the failures, but also learn from them, so I will add reflections to some of them (in progress).</description>

      <description>Don’t just network with people your own age Beware the whiz kid syndrome. Smart, young people have a habit of forming communities of other smart young people and feeding off each other’s energy. Argghhhh. Are you not just making mistakes made by older people again? Make original mistakes
Youth enclaves can actually be restrictive. In fact their networking should be about meeting useful mentors and career champions who can open doors and fast track careers.</description>

      <title>The Good Fight</title>

      <description>In the first few pages of the book Born Standing Up, Steve says something poignant:
 One can have, it turns out, an affection for the war years.
 He was someone chasing something external: fame, glory, money or a version of these. Yet, in his dusk years — once he had achieved some of those, he valued his struggle more than his fame and glory.
For Steve, it was not about achieving these, it was, as I have come to call it: a good fight.</description>
