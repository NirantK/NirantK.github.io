      <description>Who is this for? Practitioners who are looking to level up their game in Deep Learning
Why Do We Need Instructions on How to Read a Deep Learning Paper? Quantity: There are more papers than we can humanly read even within our own niche. For instance, consider EMNLP - which is arguably the most popular Natural Language Processing conference selects more than 2K papers across a variety of topics. And NLP is just one area!</description>

      <description>Like most of my essays, this essay is written for myself from few years ago.
Software Engineering, and it&amp;rsquo;s cousins like Computer Science are unique. Unlike relatively mature domains of say, linear algebra - the field is still growing and not yet coherent. That makes it some what hard to study and master.
This also means we have a unique opportunity here. This makes it better to work in a field which is not yet c</description>

      <title>Data Science Org Designs</title>

      <description>Data Science Org Design While there is plenty of good advice on making ML work and making a career as a Data Scientist - I think very little discussion happens on the organization design for Data Science itself.
 Organization Design is determined by these 3 broad categories:
  Software Engineer vs Research: To what extent is the Machine Learning team responsible for building or integrating with software? How important are Software Engineering skills on the team?</description>

      <description>When I show up to Dr. Bob’s office, I don’t expect to deal with Bob; I expect to deal with The Doctor. The doctor is not going to behave as Bob, Alice, or Caroline might act, even if that’s who the doctor is. The doctor is going to behave as The Doctor! This is essentially a human user interface. I’m not Samo. I am The Patient. And Alice is The Doctor.</description>

      <title>First 90 Days - Software Engineer Version</title>

      <guid>https://nirantk.com/writing/first-90-days-engineer-version.html</guid>
      <description>Aditya Ankur, asked me:
I know that there is a book for the first 90 days as an executive. Is there something similar for programmers?
I don&amp;rsquo;t quite know of a book/essay which covers this yet sticks to the question. So I am writing one for him.
The First 90 Days for a New Engineer I expect each step to take roughly between 10 and 30 days, depending on the pace of your project + size of the team.</description>

      <title>Case Study: Building a Data Science Team at a Startup</title>

      <description>Hello!
If we are meeting for the first time, a short version of my story so far: After doing research engineering for almost 4 years across startups and a BigCo, I joined as an early machine learning engineer at Verloop.io - a B2B startup that makes customer support automation SaaS. We&amp;rsquo;re directly responsible for most Natural Language Processing needs within the business.
While there is plenty of good advice on making ML work and making a career as a Data Scientist, I wanted to write my experience as a manager/early engineer who built out a ML team at a startup.</description>

      <title>Verloop NLP Interview Prep Guide</title>
      <link>https://nirantk.com/writing/verloop-ml-prep-guide.html</link>

      <guid>https://nirantk.com/writing/verloop-ml-prep-guide.html</guid>
      <description>Preparation Guide I&amp;rsquo;ve been an early Machine Learning Engineer at Verloop.io for almost 1.5 years, primarily working on NLP problems and now more in an Engineering Manager-ish role.
This is the guide which I sometimes send to our candidates after they submit the Programming Challenge. If a candidate has relevant open source code sample, specially to other repositories we may choose to waive off the Programming Challenge completely.
I originally wrote this to give a chance to folks coming from non-NLP background to get a sense of the problem space a little better.</description>

      <description>Who is this for? This is written for me, 5 years ago - when I was starting my career in Data Science. You can treat these as Notes/Advice/Rant/Opinion.
That said, I expect this to be helpful to:
  Early to Mid Career Folks in Engineering roles considering moving to ML/Data Science
  Primarily written for those in India
 Rant: If you&amp;rsquo;re not in India and any of this applies to you, please consider hiring a career coach - you&amp;rsquo;ve too much low hanging fruit in planning your career    Rant: Note that the most obnoxious, random comments will be marked by Rant.</description>

      <description>Mayank asked on Twitter:
 Some ideas/papers/tools on monitoring models in production. A use case would be say a classification task over large inputs. I want to visualise how are the predicted values or even confidence scores vary over time? (paraphrased)
 Quick Hacks pandas-profiling If you are logging confidence scores, you can begin there. The quickest hack is to visualize with pandas-profiling: https://github.com/pandas-profiling/pandas-profiling/
Rolling means Calculate rolling aggregates (e.g. mean, variance) of your confidence scores.</description>

      <description>This piece is primarily meant for those new to Python. These include mathematicians, economists, and so on who want to use Python within a Jupyter environment. Here is a quick guide on how to make Best of Jupyter.
Quick Primer If you are familiar with earlier Python versions, here are my top picks on how to move from .format () to this new one:
_fstring = f&amp;#39;Total: {one + two}&amp;#39; # Go f-string!</description>

      <title>The Silent Rise of PyTorch Ecosystem</title>
      <link>https://nirantk.com/writing/silentriseofpytorch.html</link>

      <description>The Silent Rise of PyTorch Ecosystem While Tensorflow has made peace with Keras as it’s high level API and mxNet now support Gluon — PyTorch is the bare matrix love.
PyTorch has seen rapid adoption in academia and all the industrial labs that I have spoken to as well. One of the reasons people (specially engineers doing experiments) like PyTorch is the ease of debugging.
What I don’t like about PyTorch is it’s incessant requirement of debugging because of inconsistent dimensions problems.</description>

      <description>A Getting Started Guide
Let us get our facts straight, shall we?
I am writing from my non-existent but probably relevant experience. I worked in a Machine Learning role at Samsung Research, Bengaluru. It is only 1 of the 4 research enterprises which hire Machine Learning researchers from Indian colleges — the other being Microsoft, Xerox, and IBM Watson.
I am now in a even more Computer Vision focused role for a small enterprise tech company.</description>
