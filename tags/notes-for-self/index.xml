      <description>This is a follow up on Identity - or Keep Your Identity Small by Paul Graham.
I&amp;rsquo;ve added the relevant excerpts below in case you have not read that already, though I highly recommend that you do.
The essay is little more than 10 years old at this point. I&amp;rsquo;m disappointed because no one has written a good method on how to act on the advice which Paul shares in that piece.</description>
