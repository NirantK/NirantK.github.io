      <title>Verloop ML Interview Prep Guide</title>

      <description>Preparation Guide I&amp;rsquo;ve been an early Machine Learning Engineer at Verloop.io for almost 1.5 years, primarily working on NLP problems and now more in an Engineering Manager-ish role.
This is the guide which I sometimes send to our candidates after they submit the Programming Challenge.
If a candidate has relevant open source code sample, specially to other repositories we may choose to waive off the Programming Challenge completely.
I hope this is most useful to candidate interviewing for ML roles in companies similar to us in terms of size, scale and challenges.</description>
