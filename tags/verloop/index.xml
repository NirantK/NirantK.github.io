      <description>Hello, if we are meeting for the first time, a short version of my story so far: After doing research engineering for almost 4 years across startups and Samsung Research, I joined as an early machine learning engineer at Verloop.io - a B2B startup that makes customer support automation SaaS. We&amp;rsquo;re directly responsible for most Data Science needs within the business.
While there is plenty of good advice on making ML work and making a career as a Data Scientist, I want to do a retrospective on what I&amp;rsquo;ve learnt in building a team which is far more competent than I am.</description>

      <title>Verloop NLP Interview Prep Guide</title>

      <description>Preparation Guide I&amp;rsquo;ve been an early Machine Learning Engineer at Verloop.io for almost 1.5 years, primarily working on NLP problems and now more in an Engineering Manager-ish role.
This is the guide which I sometimes send to our candidates after they submit the Programming Challenge. If a candidate has relevant open source code sample, specially to other repositories we may choose to waive off the Programming Challenge completely.
I originally wrote this to give a chance to folks coming from non-NLP background to get a sense of the problem space a little better.</description>
