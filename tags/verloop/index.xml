      <description>Revised: September 2020 from here
Great Startups always ask someone who is joining for a reference check. They speak to your previous managers and colleagues. There is no reason why candidates should not do the same. In fact, in many ways - startup employees have more opportunity costs than the founders themselves.
I&amp;rsquo;m always surprised by the lack of due diligence which candidates do when interviewing with us. I assume that atleast a part of this is that they can do this, and further: how to evaluate engineering team worth working with?</description>
