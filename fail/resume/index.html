<h1 id="failure-resume">Failure Resume :)</h1>

<p>A failure resume is, as its name suggests, a list of rejections and setbacks.</p>

<p>This concept originated in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/03/smarter-living/failure-resume.html">academia</a>, but can be applied to improve one’s career, resilience, and approach to challenges in any walk of life.</p>

<p>I’ve organized my setbacks by year (starting with 2016), and what constitutes a “failure” here is based solely on my own judgement.
It’s important to not only list the failures, but also learn from them, so I will add reflections to some of them (in progress).
This isn’t an exhaustive list.</p>

<ul>
<li>Spent 6 weeks prototyping a solution at Verloop.io which doesn&rsquo;t break even on cost

<ul>
<li>Lesson Learnt: In Enterprise SaaS, never write any code before someone tells you what they are willing to pay for that</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h1 id="2018">2018</h1>

<ul>
<li>Did not even get interview callbacks from my favourite NLP Company at the time: <a href="https://rasa.com/">Rasa</a></li>
<li>Had to quit Soroco because of lack of opportunities to grow internally. Really loved the crew, which was smart but not agile or humble</li>
<li>Did not even apply to GoJek, Linkedin and Swiggy&rsquo;s kickass Data Science teams

<ul>
<li>Lesson learnt: Be proactive. Take moonshots. Setting an upper-cap on your ambitions is kinda stupid</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Inspired from <a href="https://katmh.com/fail/">Katherine Huang&rsquo;s Fail Resume</a></p>
