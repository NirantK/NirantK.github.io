Then something remarkably interesting happens:
When that happens, it drops the general quality of the community down such that the next most high value contributors now find the community underwhelming. Each layer of disappearances slowly reduces the average quality of the group until such a point that you reach the people who are so unskilled-and-unaware of it that they’re unable to tell that they’re part of a mediocre group.</div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Writing</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=https://nirantk.com/writing/standout.html class="link black dim">Standing Out at Work</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">In my short career, I&rsquo;ve seen some amazing young people stand out at work.

Your profit+growth percentage should be a minimum 40%
So say, you join a big company like Microsoft and your skills grow at 20% every year, while your pay only grows 10% - that&rsquo;s bad.
You need to grow your skills and outcomes faster.
The other extreme is also fine: You join a small startup which can make great use of entrepreneurial DNA plus specific skills.</div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Writing</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=https://nirantk.com/writing/picking-startup-to-work-with.html class="link black dim">Picking a Startup Team You Want to Work With</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Why we need to do a reference check on startup teams we work with?

Like your net worth, this does not mean that you have that much cash to spend. It is a sum total of something.
Net Worth is the Sum Total of the Assets & Liabilities
Character is the Sum Total of the Decisions you Own: Good and Bad

Then something remarkably interesting happens:
When that happens, it drops the general quality of the community down such that the next most high value contributors now find the community underwhelming. Each layer of disappearances slowly reduces the average quality of the group until such a point that you reach the people who are so unskilled-and-unaware of it that they’re unable to tell that they’re part of a mediocre group.</div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Writing</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=https://nirantk.com/writing/failresume.html class="link black dim">Fail Resume</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">A fail resume is, as its name suggests, a list of rejections and setbacks.
This concept originated in academia, but can be applied to improve one’s career, resilience, and approach to challenges in any walk of life.
I’ve organized my setbacks by year (starting with 2016), and what constitutes a “failure” (or fail) here is based solely on my own judgement. It’s important to not only list the failures, but also learn from them, so I will add reflections to some of them (in progress).</div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Writing</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=https://nirantk.com/writing/actlike35.html class="link black dim">Act Like You're 35</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Don’t just network with people your own age Beware the whiz kid syndrome.

One can have, it turns out, an affection for the war years.
He was someone chasing something external: fame, glory, money or a version of these. Yet, in his dusk years — once he had achieved some of those, he valued his struggle more than his fame and glory.
For Steve, it was not about achieving these, it was, as I have come to call it: a good fight.</div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Writing</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=https://nirantk.com/writing/bitsian.html class="link black dim">The BITS Pilani Experience</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">There is a invisible binding thread among most BITSian’s - optimistic, easy going, but somewhat pragmatic.
