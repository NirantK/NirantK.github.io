Practitioners who are looking to level up their game in Deep Learning
Why Do We Need Instructions on How to Read a Deep Learning Paper? Quantity: There are more papers than we can humanly read even within our own niche. For instance, consider EMNLP - which is arguably the most popular Natural Language Processing conference selects more than 2K papers across a variety of topics. And NLP is just one area!</description></item><item><title>Character is Net Worth</title><link>https://nirantk.com/writing/character-is-net-worth/</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 Oct 2020 00:09:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://nirantk.com/writing/character-is-net-worth/</guid><description>A useful metaphor to think about character of a person is their financial “net worth”. Like your net worth, this does not mean that you have that much cash to spend. It is a sum total of something.
Net Worth is the Sum Total of the Assets &amp;amp; Liabilities
Character is the Sum Total of the Decisions you Own: Good and Bad
Like your Net Worth can be negative due to a large liability e.</description></item><item><title>First 90 Days - Software Engineer Version</title><link>https://nirantk.com/writing/first-90-days-engineer-version/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Sep 2020 00:09:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://nirantk.com/writing/first-90-days-engineer-version/</guid><description>Aditya Ankur, asked me:
I know that there is a book for the first 90 days as an executive. Is there something similar for programmers?
I don&amp;rsquo;t quite know of a book/essay which covers this yet sticks to the question. So I am writing one for him.
The First 90 Days for a New Engineer I expect each step to take roughly between 10 and 30 days, depending on the pace of your project + size of the team.</description></item><item><title>Verloop NLP Interview Prep Guide</title><link>https://nirantk.com/writing/verloop-ml-prep-guide/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 Aug 2020 00:09:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://nirantk.com/writing/verloop-ml-prep-guide/</guid><description>Preparation Guide I&amp;rsquo;ve been an early Machine Learning Engineer at Verloop.io for almost 1.5 years, primarily working on NLP problems and now more in an Engineering Manager-ish role.
This is the guide which I sometimes send to our candidates after they submit the Programming Challenge. If a candidate has relevant open source code sample, specially to other repositories we may choose to waive off the Programming Challenge completely.
I originally wrote this to give a chance to folks coming from non-NLP background to get a sense of the problem space a little better.</description></item><item><title>Talent Cooling</title><link>https://nirantk.com/writing/talentcooling/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Aug 2020 00:09:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://nirantk.com/writing/talentcooling/</guid><description>Talent Cooling Kills Startup Growth Evaporative Cooling [1] occurs when the most high value contributors to a community realize that the community is no longer serving their needs any more and so therefore, leave.
Then something remarkably interesting happens:
When that happens, it drops the general quality of the community down such that the next most high value contributors now find the community underwhelming. Each layer of disappearances slowly reduces the average quality of the group until such a point that you reach the people who are so unskilled-and-unaware of it that they’re unable to tell that they’re part of a mediocre group.</description></item><item><title>Shreyas Karanth: Moving from SW Engg to Product</title><link>https://nirantk.com/writing/shreyas/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jun 2020 00:09:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://nirantk.com/writing/shreyas/</guid><description>Shreyas Karanth is a Product Manager at Soroco.

This concept originated in academia, but can be applied to improve one’s career, resilience, and approach to challenges in any walk of life.
I’ve organized my setbacks by year (starting with 2016), and what constitutes a “failure” (or fail) here is based solely on my own judgement. It’s important to not only list the failures, but also learn from them, so I will add reflections to some of them (in progress).</description></item><item><title>Ankit Nagori, Co-Founder of Cult</title><link>https://nirantk.com/writing/ankitnagori/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Apr 2020 00:00:09 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://nirantk.com/writing/ankitnagori/</guid><description>Last month, I had a chance to talk to Ankit Nagori - the co-founder at Cult or Cure.fit

Smart, young people have a habit of forming communities of other smart young people and feeding off each other’s energy. Argghhhh. Are you not just making mistakes made by older people again?

Youth enclaves can actually be restrictive.

Your profit+growth percentage should be a minimum 40%
So say, you join a big company like Microsoft and your skills grow at 20% every year, while your pay only grows 10% - that&amp;rsquo;s bad.
You need to grow your skills and outcomes faster.
The other extreme is also fine: You join a small startup which can make great use of entrepreneurial DNA plus specific skills.</description></item><item><title>Happy Diwali 2019</title><link>https://nirantk.com/writing/diwali_2019/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Nov 2019 00:09:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://nirantk.com/writing/diwali_2019/</guid><description>I wanted to drop by and wish you a very Happy Diwali!

PyTorch has seen rapid adoption in academia and all the industrial labs that I have spoken to as well. One of the reasons people (specially engineers doing experiments) like PyTorch is the ease of debugging.
What I don’t like about PyTorch is it’s incessant requirement of debugging because of inconsistent dimensions problems.</description></item><item><title>Tech Talk Tips</title><link>https://nirantk.com/writing/techtalktips/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Aug 2019 23:29:18 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://nirantk.com/writing/techtalktips/</guid><description>Collection of the Best Advice on Internet that I know about on giving a tech talk.

Great Startups always ask someone who is joining for a reference check. They speak to your previous managers and colleagues. There is no reason why candidates should not do the same.

One can have, it turns out, an affection for the war years.
He was someone chasing something external: fame, glory, money or a version of these. Yet, in his dusk years — once he had achieved some of those, he valued his struggle more than his fame and glory.
