      <description>ML Model Monitoring Mayank asked on Twitter:
 Some ideas/papers/tools on monitoring models in production. A use case would be say a classification task over large inputs. I want to visualise how are the predicted values or even confidence scores vary over time? (paraphrased)
 Quick Hacks pandas-profiling If you are logging confidence scores, you can begin there. The quickest hack is to visualize with pandas-profiling: https://github.com/pandas-profiling/pandas-profiling/

      <description>This piece is primarily meant for those new to Python. These include mathematicians, economists, and so on who want to use Python within a Jupyter environment. Here is a quick guide on how to make Best of Jupyter.
Quick Primer If you are familiar with earlier Python versions, here are my top picks on how to move from .format () to this new one:
_fstring = f&amp;#39;Total: {one + two}&amp;#39; # Go f-string!</description>

      <title>The Silent Rise of PyTorch Ecosystem</title>

      <description>The Silent Rise of PyTorch Ecosystem While Tensorflow has made peace with Keras as it’s high level API and mxNet now support Gluon — PyTorch is the bare matrix love.
PyTorch has seen rapid adoption in academia and all the industrial labs that I have spoken to as well. One of the reasons people (specially engineers doing experiments) like PyTorch is the ease of debugging.
What I don’t like about PyTorch is it’s incessant requirement of debugging because of inconsistent dimensions problems.</description>

      <title>Fail Resume</title>

      <description>A failure resume is, as its name suggests, a list of rejections and setbacks.
This concept originated in academia, but can be applied to improve one’s career, resilience, and approach to challenges in any walk of life.
I’ve organized my setbacks by year (starting with 2016), and what constitutes a “failure” here is based solely on my own judgement. It’s important to not only list the failures, but also learn from them, so I will add reflections to some of them (in progress).</description>

My previous workplaces made a serious dent in the size of my dreams. It is only at welcoming meadow work culture at Verloop - that I&amp;rsquo;ve come to feel like going back on the chase.</description>

      <description>In the first few pages of the book Born Standing Up, Steve says something poignant:
 One can have, it turns out, an affection for the war years.
 He was someone chasing something external: fame, glory, money or a version of these. Yet, in his dusk years — once he had achieved some of those, he valued his struggle more than his fame and glory.
For Steve, it was not about achieving these, it was, as I have come to call it: a good fight.</description>

      <description>Part I I once travelled in a crowded dusty general compartment of our lovely Indian Railways from Mumbai to Hyderabad. I left from Mumbai on an evening train. Across me, sat a man with a silver beard in a Gandhi topi, white kurta and black jeans. He had a black laptop bag filled with what sounded like chocolate wrappers. When his phone rang, I heard him take a call in prosaic English.</description>

      <description>A Getting Started Guide
Let us get our facts straight, shall we?
I am writing from my non-existent but probably relevant experience. I worked in a Machine Learning role at Samsung Research, Bengaluru. It is only 1 of the 4 research enterprises which hire Machine Learning researchers from Indian colleges — the other being Microsoft, Xerox, and IBM Watson.
I am now in a even more Computer Vision focused role for a small enterprise tech company.</description>
