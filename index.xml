      <title>Moving from Engineering to PM: Shreyas Karanth</title>
      <link>https://nirantk.com/writing/shreyas/</link>

      <description>Nirant: What have you loved the most, in transitioning from tech to product?
Shreyas: 1. 90% of the articles I read when I was in tech, were &amp;ldquo;product&amp;rdquo; articles. What has been great is actually putting these things (that I&amp;rsquo;d read over the course of 2 years) into practice. Even small things, like coming up with a set of questions to ask customers, require me to go through articles and books that I&amp;rsquo;d bookmarked over the years, and then actually using those tips.</description>

      <title>Fail Resume</title>
      <link>https://nirantk.com/writing/failresume/</link>

      <description>A fail resume is, as its name suggests, a list of rejections and setbacks.
This concept originated in academia, but can be applied to improve one’s career, resilience, and approach to challenges in any walk of life.
I’ve organized my setbacks by year (starting with 2016), and what constitutes a “failure” (or fail) here is based solely on my own judgement. It’s important to not only list the failures, but also learn from them, so I will add reflections to some of them (in progress).</description>

      <title>Thinking of Your Career as a Startup</title>
      <link>https://nirantk.com/writing/ruleof40/</link>

      <description>Broadly speaking, it’s useful to think of your career as a startup.
Your profit+growth percentage should be a minimum 40%
So say, you join a big company like Microsoft and your skills grow at 20% every year, while your pay only grows 10% - that&amp;rsquo;s bad.
You need to grow your skills and outcomes faster.
The other extreme is also fine: You join a small startup which can make great use of entrepreneurial DNA plus specific skills.</description>

      <description>On Death  Is usually better the sooner it happens. Just like it’s best to retire from your cricket career at your peak for your own sake, it’s best to die when you are at your peak. You just might become Father of the Nation.
 No one wishes that they’d accomplished less on their death beds. You might hear that no one wishes that they’d worked more. That’s right too.</description>

Quick Primer If you are familiar with earlier Python versions, here are my top picks on how to move from .format () to this new one:
_fstring = f&amp;#39;Total: {one + two}&amp;#39; # Go f-string!</description>

      <title>The Silent Rise of PyTorch Ecosystem</title>

      <description>The Silent Rise of PyTorch Ecosystem While Tensorflow has made peace with Keras as it’s high level API and mxNet now support Gluon — PyTorch is the bare matrix love.
PyTorch has seen rapid adoption in academia and all the industrial labs that I have spoken to as well. One of the reasons people (specially engineers doing experiments) like PyTorch is the ease of debugging.
What I don’t like about PyTorch is it’s incessant requirement of debugging because of inconsistent dimensions problems.</description>

      <description>In the first few pages of the book Born Standing Up, Steve says something poignant:
 One can have, it turns out, an affection for the war years.
 He was someone chasing something external: fame, glory, money or a version of these. Yet, in his dusk years — once he had achieved some of those, he valued his struggle more than his fame and glory.
For Steve, it was not about achieving these, it was, as I have come to call it: a good fight.</description>

      <description>A Getting Started Guide
Let us get our facts straight, shall we?
I am writing from my non-existent but probably relevant experience. I worked in a Machine Learning role at Samsung Research, Bengaluru. It is only 1 of the 4 research enterprises which hire Machine Learning researchers from Indian colleges — the other being Microsoft, Xerox, and IBM Watson.
I am now in a even more Computer Vision focused role for a small enterprise tech company.</description>
